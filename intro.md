# Introduction: 

Hi, I'm Tyler. 

I wrote this e-book throughout the development of my first custom (and heavily hypothetical) programming language. I embarked on the journey for honors credit in my course on the Principles of Programming Languages in Fall 2015. 

## Motivation

To be clear, I am starting out with little to no knowledge on the development of programming languages. I know how to use computer languages, but I do not know how they use things. As my course goes on, I am sure to gain insight into the realms unknown; redirecting any intentions I could initially define today. Though, I can explain my motivations. 

- Motivation #1 - Understand how programming languages do things. 
- Motivation #2 - Try and define a hypothetical language, whatever that may mean.
- Motivation #3 - Satisfy my honors credit. 

## Where is this going?

I have no idea. I can give you my best guess. 

I know that a programming language will have a purpose, or a set of purposes that it's written to fulfill.  Once I have a better understanding of the inner workings of programming languages, I will be better equipped to identify the purpose I want my language to fulfill. As of right now, I plan on developing something in the realm of home automation, or maybe print design. 

## Format

In order to have something to present at midterm, I will use a diary style rhetoric. I won't know enough about programming languages to start developing one until midterm, optimistically. However, keeping this project in mind, and writing my thoughts down as I go should help. In other words, I'm going to write like I think, and I promise to keep it as simple as possible.
