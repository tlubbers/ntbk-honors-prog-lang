# Final Thoughts

The work that goes into making a programming language is extensive, which really wasn't that surprising. Even the basics require are semesters worth of getting your mind wrapped around the concepts. I still get syntax and semantics turned around in my head. 

The most important thing I learned from this exercise was that programming languages are not magic. There is no magnificent wizard sniffs code and sprinkles binary. Furthermore, it doesn't involve overly complicated concepts that only a genius could comprehend. Many of the tricks that are used when writing with a program language are also so for the writing the program language. 

The idea of creating your own language is just another type of abstraction in the long list of abstractions that add up to computer science. Anyone can understand it, and anyone can do it. It's not magic.
