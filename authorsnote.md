Hi, I'm Tyler. 

During the fall semester of 2015, I worked to fulfill an Honor's Credit Contract for my Programming Language Principles class at Illinois State University. The work guidelines for the project were relatively open ended, but required 15 hours of additional work (one extra hour a week). 

I chose to research the processes and concepts required to develop a programming language. It goes without saying that 15 hours is not enough time to actually develop a programming language, hence, the language described here is extremely hypothetical. 

I defined three main goals to guide me throughout this project. 

1. Why develop a programming language?
2. How does someone start building a programming language?
3. What problems do program language developers face throughout development?
