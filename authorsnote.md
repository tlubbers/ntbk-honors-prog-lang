Hi, I'm Tyler. 

During the fall semester of 2015, I worked to fulfill an Honor's Credit Contract for my Programming Language Principles class at Illinois State University. The work guidelines for the project were relatively open ended, but required 15 hours of additional work (one extra hour a week). 

I chose to research the processes and concepts required to develop a programming language. It goes without saying that 15 hours is not enough time to actually develop a programming language, hence, the language described here is extremely hypothetical. 

I defined three main questions to guide me throughout this project. 

1. Why develop a programming language?
2. How do programming languages get started?
3. What problems do program language developers face throughout development? 


### Report Format

This report has been separated into three main sections, based on the three aforementioned questions. Some additional analysis is provided in the final section, titled "Further Thoughts",.
