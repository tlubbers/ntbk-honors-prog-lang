# Why make a programming language?

The answer to this question is very simple. A programming language is designed to solve a problem. Some languages are meant to solve lots of problems, and others (often called domain style languages) are meant to solve a small set of problems in a particular **domain**.

## Authors Note
For a little under four years, I worked at a small print shop in the downtown district of my hometown. The job-title I made up for myself was "Print Specialist". I worked daily with any number of different printers, scanners, plotters, etc.

I loved that little shop, and I'm relatively sure I will always refer to it as the best job I ever had. Of course, it wasn't without it's annoyances; it was still a job. The biggest of which had to do with getting customer files to the machine they needed to get to. Each machine had it's own interface, and each interface was completely different than any other.

The terminology was different, the categories were different, everything was different.  To make matters worse, every interface seemed to update every month, and the upgraded version would be nothing like the original version.
