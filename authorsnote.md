Hi, I'm Tyler. 

I wrote this e-book throughout the development of my first custom (and heavily hypothetical) programming language. I embarked on the journey for honors credit in my course on the Principles of Programming Languages in Fall 2015. 


To be clear, I am starting out with little to no knowledge on the development of programming languages. I know how to use computer languages, but I do not know how they use things. As I learn new topics, surely any goal I initially define will be short sighted.  

- Goal #1 - Understand how programming languages do things. 
- Goal #2 - Try and define a hypothetical language, whatever that may mean.
- Goal #3 - Satisfy my honors credit. 

## Where is this going?

I have no idea. I can give you my best guess. 

I know that a programming language will have a purpose, or a set of purposes that it's written to fulfill.  Once I understand the basics of defining a programming language, I will able to identify a problem for it to solve. As of right now, I plan on developing something in the realm of home automation, or maybe print design.
