# I shall call it Printdown!

I think I now know enough about the development of programming languages to define my goals for this project. I have scrapped the home automation plan, and decided to focus on the printing domain. Here is what I am planning. 

- Propose a new DSL called Printdown
    - A language aimed at simplifying print settings. 
    
- Define the problems Printdown Solves

- Define the syntax and semantics of Printdown

- Define basic interpretations

- Build a very basic compiler based on either javascript or c.
