Hi, I'm Tyler. 

During the fall semester of 2015, I worked to fulfill an Honor's Credit Contract for my Programming Language Principles class at Illinois State University. The work guidelines for the project were relatively open ended, but required 15 hours of additional work (one extra hour a week). 

I chose to research the processes and concepts required to develop a programming language. It goes without saying that 15 hours is not enough time to actually develop a programming language, hence, the language described here is extremely hypothetical. 

I defined three main goals to guide me throughout this project. 

1. Why does someone choose to develop a programming language?
2. How does someone start building a programming language?
3. 

## Where is this going?

I have no idea. I can give you my best guess. 

I know that a programming language will have a purpose, or a set of purposes that it's written to fulfill.  Once I understand the basics of defining a programming language, I will able to identify a problem for it to solve. As of right now, I plan on developing something in the realm of home automation, or maybe print design.
