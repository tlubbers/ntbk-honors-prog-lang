# Languages

Programming languages just "magically" work right? Apparently, they do not. Programming Languages have a lot in common with normal languages, which makes sense intuitively, but I never made that connection. And just like a normal language, they depend on **grammar rules** to work.

## Grammar
A programming language is described with its **semantics** and its **syntax**. The semantics tells us what is possible in that programming language. The syntax gives us its structure.

Describing syntax is a much studied topic, and really smart people have narrowed all down to **context free grammars.** Note that context exists in any language, not just programming languages. 

If I said "I saw a man with a telescope", the context leads you to two different conclusions. This is fine for a human that speaks the language; they will figure out what I mean. A machine isn't going to have any idea what that sentence means though. In-fact, if I was a machine, I would have to zoom down into that sentence and read it one character at a time. Have a little sympathy for the robots.

A programming language uses grammar rules to maintain a context free environment.

I know now, that at some point, I will be defining these grammar rules for my language.
