# The Printdown Programming Language
_A theoretical programming language developed by Tyler Lubbers_

## A note from the author

Hi, I'm Tyler. 

During the fall semester of 2015, I worked to fulfill an Honor's Credit Contract for my Programming Language Principles class at Illinois State University. The work guidelines for the project were relatively open ended, but required 15 hours of additional work (one extra hour a week). 

I chose to research the processes and concepts required to develop a programming language. It goes without saying that 15 hours is not enough time to actually develop a programming language, hence, the language described here is extremely hypothetical. 

I defined three main questions to guide me throughout this project. 

1. Why develop a programming language?
2. How do programming languages get started?
3. What would my language look like in action? 


### Report Format

This report has been separated into three main sections, based on the three aforementioned questions. Some additional analysis is provided in the final section, titled "Further Thoughts".

I wrote this report assuming the reader has a basic understanding of programming. Some topics are supported by the inclusion of code snippets, which I wrote in javascript. Readers familiar with basic programming will have an easier time understanding these sections, but full comprehension of the code is not required. 

##### Thanks! Enjoy!
Tyler Lubbers
