Hi, I'm Tyler. 

During the fall semester of 2015, I worked to fulfill an Honor's Credit Contract for my Programming Language Principles class at Illinois State University. 

- Goal #1 - Understand how programming languages do things. 
- Goal #2 - Try and define a hypothetical language, whatever that may mean.
- Goal #3 - Satisfy my honors credit. 

## Where is this going?

I have no idea. I can give you my best guess. 

I know that a programming language will have a purpose, or a set of purposes that it's written to fulfill.  Once I understand the basics of defining a programming language, I will able to identify a problem for it to solve. As of right now, I plan on developing something in the realm of home automation, or maybe print design.
